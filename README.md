# âš¡ TransVolt Voltage Dashboard

A lightweight Flask web application for visualizing and analyzing voltage data.  
It generates *interactive dashboards* with multiple charts and data tables, including:

- ğŸ“ˆ *Original Voltage Data*
- ğŸ”´ *5-Day Moving Average*
- ğŸŸ¢ *Local Peaks & Troughs*
- âš  *Voltage Below 20 Detection*
- â¬‡ *Downward Acceleration Points*

All charts are rendered server-side using *Matplotlib* and served in a clean Bootstrap-based interface.
